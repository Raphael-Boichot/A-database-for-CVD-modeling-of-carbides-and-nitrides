## Public repository of databases for CFD modeling of AlN, TiN, CrC and SiC growth with CFD-Ace

General disclaimer : these databases have been developped in SIMAP laboratory between 2006 and 2023 for internal use with custom CVD reactors. The related papers in which these models have been used are given in description. Use at your own risk. These models have been used essentially for simulatinf epitaxial growth (microelectronics industry) and hard coatings for harsh Environment (Nuclear and Solar Energy).

All codes are to be used with [CFD-Ace from Applied Materials](https://www.appliedmaterials.com/us/en/semiconductor/solutions-and-software/software-solutions/ace-plus-suite.html), a general CFD modeling software suite.

## SiC growth
# Suppporting data for paper [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surfcoat.2020.126102](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surfcoat.2020.126102)

This model is the oldest but it has been extensively used and modified until 2019. It embeds chemistry of the Si-C-H-Cl system on gas phase to perform simulations of SiC growth from a mixture od silane, propane and chlorine. Chlorine is used here only to reduce the elementary silicon vapor pressure and avoid condensation of pure silicon during growth. Last use of this code was for simulation SiC growth on refractory metal tiles for Concentrated Solar Panel (CSP) applications.
